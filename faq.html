          <summary>Does PakSolve provide university admission advice</summary>
          <div class="answer">Unfortunately, stating that your program in Pakistan provides uiversity counselling makes it a target for hundreds of individuals who hunt for programs with the sole focus of connecting with people studying at ivy league schools and getting counselling advice from them. From past experience, we know that such individuals tend to take up slots in programs that could have gone to deserving candidates and they seldom engage with the actual program material. For this reason, PakSolve does not offer any university counselling, our goal is simply to spread problem solving skills and a love for Physics and Math. If you meet our eligibility and are excited for an amazing oppurtunity to work hard and learn something meaningful, please signup. But if you are simply looking for a surface level connection with MIT students for uni admission brownie points, you won't find that here.</div>

          <summary>How much Math do I need to know to be able to signup for PakSolve</summary>
          <div class="answer">If you are curious, enjoy math and you're strong at basic middle school algebra, then this is theoretically enough to find success here. That said, if all you know is algebra, then you will need to work very hard as our study of Calculus will require being comfortable with trignometry, functions, quadratic equations and more. We recognise that participants will come in with a host of different backgrounds and we will cater to everyone. You will be provided support to cover any knowledge you need and don't have coming into our study of Calculus. Please do not let fear of not having enough prior knowledge dissuade you from applying.</div>

          <summary>If I already know basic Calculus and intro Physics, should I not apply to PakSolve?</summary>
          <div class="answer">Not at all. You may still get a lot of benefit from PakSolve. Firstly, our course's main objective is not just to teach you calculus, it's to teach you to be a good thinker and to develop good mathematical and physical problem solving skills. We won't be giving you any cookie cutter problems where you can solve a dozen problems with the same repretitive methods. Your Pset problems will be tough, non triovial and will require creative thought even if you are already comfortable witht the material. If we find that you're very ahead of the rest of the class, we will make sure to give you extra challenging problems. Secondly, there's a good chance you don't actually know Calculus or Physics very well after all. Pakistani schools do a terrible job at covering these subjects. If you know how to differentiate and integrate but you don't have a good conceptual understanding of what a limit is or the physical meaning behind integration, then you have haven't learned caclulus, you've only learned a couple formulae and when to apply them. We will make sure to impart you with a strong conceptual understanding of Calculus and Physics.</div>
