    <h2>What is the PakSolve Fellowship?</h2>
     <p>
          In order to succeed in goal 2, a small cohort of you will be admitted to the PakSolve Fellowship. This will mean a few things. Firstly, you will be given exponentially more direct, one on one attention during this program. This direct attention will also mean that you will have room to personalise your study with PakSolve as we will be able to mold our syllabus to the specific likings and needs of Fellowship members. Secondly, we will continue to work with students who make it into the fellowship throughout their high school careers, and provide them with amazing opportunities like representing Pakistan in the International Math, Physics or Informatics Olympiads. Getting into the fellowship is a gateway into opportunities in Math, Physics and Computer Science and connections with some of today's most successful young Pakistanis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting into the Fellowship DOES NOT depend only on how good you are at Math. It will be based on demonstrated effort and enthusiasm for the course as well as how much progress and mathematical growth you show throughout the program. The rationale behind this decision is to make getting into the fellowship fair for younger students and for people who enter this program with less background knowledge. If you are someone who is really good and ahead of your year group at Math and Physics: don't worry, your prior knowledge will still help you qualify, (we are looking for talent after all and it would be stupid to not try to enroll very gifted students) it just won't guarantee entry into the Fellowship without hard work and effort, and students who come into the program with less prior knowledge will be given ample opportunities to demonstrate progress and qualify with just as much certainty as you.
