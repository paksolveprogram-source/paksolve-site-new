    <h2>PakSolve's Mission</h2>
        <p>
          It’s no secret that Pakistan is very behind the rest of the world in innovation. At the same time, people constantly claim that Pakistani students have crazy high potential. This is both true and not true. It is unlikely that an average Pakistani student is born innately smarter than an average student in Japan for example. But it’s also true that our Pakistani students aren’t innately dumber than students anywhere else. Yet, the best students in Pakistan are far behind the best students abroad. This is evidence of the fact that students in Pakistan are not being given enough incentives or resources to live up to their intellectual potential. 
          Every Organiser and instructor at PakSolve has won something at the International Physics or Math olympiads representing Pakistan and hence we are uniquely positioned to look back and think about what kind of learning environment we ourselves would have benefited from during our O level/ Matric years.Through making this program happen, we hope to achieve two central goals: 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li> 
            Self learning is a vital skill to learn early on as a student. If you don’t take personal charge of your education and start learning on your own, at your own pace, and devoting extra time to ideas and subjects you are passionate about, you will always be pulled down by our very mediocre education system. We want to give a large number of students in Pakistan who demonstrate a spark in STEM a push to work on their interests in Science and Math by learning some relevant, rigorous Math and Physics and to launch their journeys on self learning and taking charge of their education.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inevitably, the reality of a program like this is that for every 100 students who are given a push to develop their interest in Science or Math, 70 will attend the first day of classes, 40 will continue to attend 3 weeks in, 15 will put in enough effort to learn all the course material, and 7 or 8 will go above and beyond and continue to become life long learners, devoting the rest of their high school years to deeply learning Math and Physics. Not only do we want to motivate a large number of students as described in goal (1), we also hope to inspire the creation of a smaller cohort of these ultra motivated, hard working students who will go on to become Pakistan's future innovators and scientists and will be able to represent our Country in International Science Olympiads.
