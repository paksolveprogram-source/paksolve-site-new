          It’s no secret that Pakistan is very behind the rest of the world in innovation. At the same time, people constantly claim that Pakistani students have crazy high potential. This is both true and not true. It is unlikely that an average Pakistani student is born innately smarter than....Read More  </p>

      <h2>Expectations We Have for You</h2>
      <p>This program will begin over the summer. There are some requirements to join.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>You have to be willing to work very hard. This program will give you amazing resources and exposure and the chance to develop problem solving skills that will serve you for your entire future careers. However, in order to actually benefit from the material, putting in the hours to struggle through the problems and material is a must. The problem sets for our program will not be trivial, algorithmic and computational like your school homework; they will be tough, require creative problem solving and sufficient effort to solve. We highly encourage you to apply to this program, but please only do so with the intention to work hard to learn some high level Math and Physics over this summer.</li>
        <li>You MUST be a student in the 8th, 9th or 10th grade or younger if you are a Matric student or a student in the 9th, 10th or 11th grade or younger if you are an O level student in order to apply to PakSolve. If you don't meet this grade requirement, please do not try to join the program as it is not for you, and you will be promptly removed once we ask for proof of grade. We may accept enthusiastic younger students who wish to join if they demonstrate sufficient knowledge to keep up with the material, but we will under no circumstances accept students who are in higher grades than the ones mentioned above.</li>
        <li>Attendance is very important. Lectures will be online and you must only miss them under exceptional circumstances. Attendance and participation will be the prime factor in selection into the PakSolve Fellowship.</li>
